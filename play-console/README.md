# Play Console templates

## Internal testing – testers list template

File: `internal-testing-testers-template.csv`

### How to use
- Replace the example rows with your testers' emails.
- Keep **one email per row**.
- Then in Google Play Console, go to **Testing → Internal testing → Testers** and import / add the emails (or copy-paste).

### Notes
- The **internal testing track** supports adding testers by email list or Google Groups (depending on your Play Console UI).
- If you already use a Google Group, you can ignore the CSV and manage membership in the group instead.
